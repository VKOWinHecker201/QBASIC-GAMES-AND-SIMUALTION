# CURSE--QBASIC
A >2MB CUI Game made by me in 5 minutes ( actually 5 minutes 20 seconds ) a 102 code line program. In QBasic. JUST FOR FUN. 
This Game was made by inspiring from the film, "Choose or Die" in Netflix. 
Just launch it in your windows. It will be suppoerted by all versions of windows. 
For linux I will recommend wine to open the .exe file. 
Hope you will enjoy :)
